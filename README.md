# CouReco
Exploring courses on Coursera

## About the Project
CouReco is a minimalistic system built to help learners navigate through the courses on Coursera, aided by a data-driven strategy. A learner could visualize different features provided in the dataset or interact with this app to find suitable courses to take. CouReco also can help identify suitable courses for a learner based on their learning preferences.

## Dataset Used
For the purpose of building CouReco, data from Coursera was scraped using the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. The final dataset thus acquired consists of 1000 instances and 14 features.
